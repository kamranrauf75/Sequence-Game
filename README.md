## Introduction

Welcome to the Sequence Board Game implementation! This project is a multiplayer game based on the popular board game called Sequence. It is implemented using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

In this game, four players participate, with two players forming a team. The objective of the game is to create a sequence of five chips in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, on the game board.

The implementation includes the following features:

1. Dynamic generation of the game board using React components.
2. WebSockets for real-time communication between the server and clients.
3. Distribution of six random cards to each player from a predefined deck.
4. Interactive gameplay where players can select a card on the board, valid moves are validated, and updates are sent to the server.
5. Display of player turn and notifications for invalid moves, winning conditions, and draws.
