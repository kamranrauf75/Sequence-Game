## Introduction

Welcome to the Sequence Board Game implementation! This project is a multiplayer game based on the popular board game called Sequence. It is implemented using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

In this game, four players participate, with two players forming a team. The objective of the game is to create a sequence of five chips in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, on the game board. However, note that the rules of the original Sequence game have been simplified for the purpose of this assignment.

The implementation includes the following features:

Dynamic generation of the game board using React components.
WebSockets for real-time communication between the server and clients.
Distribution of six random cards to each player from a predefined deck.
Interactive gameplay where players can select a card on the board, valid moves are validated, and updates are sent to the server.
Display of player turn and notifications for invalid moves, winning conditions, and draws.
Please refer to the assignment description for detailed rules and functionality requirements.
